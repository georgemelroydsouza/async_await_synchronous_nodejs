# async_await_synchronous_nodejs

Basic Program to run the NodeJs script synchronously. Came across this solution when I had to write a CRON job to run individual records with a sleep in between.


To run the program run the following command
```
docker-compose up --build --remove-orphans
docker exec -it helpdesk-mongodb bash
```
